I am a Phd student at the <a href="https://inf.ethz.ch/">Department of Computer Science</a> at ETH Zurich. I am part of the <a href="https://infsec.ethz.ch/">Information Security Group</a>, supervised by <a href="https://people.inf.ethz.ch/basin/">Prof. David Basin</a>. 

My research interests lie in the intersection of formal verification and distributed systems. In particular, I am working on the modeling and verification of distributed database systems and concurrency control protocols. I mostly work with the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover to achieve strong correctness guarantees, however I have experience working with Rocq (previously known as Coq) theorem prover as well as the Tamarin prover. During my PhD I have been focusing on the verification of isolation guarantees for concurrency control protocols. I am particularly interested in achieving reliable performant database transaction protocols and in verification techniques for reasoning about concurrency control protocols, such as refinement techniques, (co-)inductive reasoning and compositional reasoning.
